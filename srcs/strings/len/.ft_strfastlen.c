         LONGWORD fails to change any of the hole bits of LONGWORD.

         1) Is this safe?  Will it catch all the zero bytes?
         Suppose there is a byte with all zeros.  Any carry bits
         propagating from its left will fall into the hole at its
         least significant bit and stop.  Since there will be no
         carry from its most significant bit, the LSB of the
         byte to the left will be unchanged, and the zero will be
         detected.

         2) Is this worthwhile?  Will it ignore everything except
         zero bytes?  Suppose every byte of LONGWORD has a bit set
         somewhere.  There will be a carry into bit 8.  If bit 8
         is set, this will carry into bit 16.  If bit 8 is clear,
         one of bits 9-15 must be set, so there will be a carry
         into bit 16.  Similarly, there will be a carry into bit
         24.  If one of bits 24-30 is set, there will be a carry
         into bit 31, so all of the hole bits will be changed.

         The one misfire occurs when bits 24-30 are clear and bit
         31 is set; in this case, the hole at bit 31 is not
         changed.  If we had access to the processor carry flag,
         we could close this loophole by putting the fourth hole
         at bit 32!

         So it ignores everything except 128's, when they're aligned
         properly.  */
